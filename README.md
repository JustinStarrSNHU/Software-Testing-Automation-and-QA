# Hello, and welcome to the Software Testing Automation and Quality Assurance Repository of my Academic Projects🖐️

Applied testing strategies as part of the SDLC including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. Implemented unit testing (JUnit) and analyzed various testing approaches.

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The way that I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional is by testing. Various types of testing can be employed, such as white-box and black-box testing. White-box testing seeks to test the individual units of the software or code whereas black-box testing seeks to test the overall functionality of the code or software. Together, using both types of testing, we can ensure as software developers that we produce a reliable and functional product. Also, by ensuring that we follow industry standards and best practices, we can help to ensure the code, programs, and software we produce are secure. Incorporating testing as early as possible into the SDLC will help reduce costs by catching errors sooner which often lead to defects and system failures.  

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are one aspect of requirements that are essential to capture. It is vital that as a software developer, I understand exactly how a program should function and ensure that its functionality meets the needs of the users it's designed to function for. 
Each need of a user should be looked at as a specific requirement that could even be broken up into multiple requirements. It is important to remember that sometimes users have needs that are outside the scope of the design. It is important to take into consideration whether or not
specific user needs are essential to a project and at what point in the SDLC each need should be implemented if at all. No matter what, without users, there would be no purpose for the application or system that is being designed. It is important to not let users feel abandoned and to give them a sense that their voice is 
important when it comes to an application's functionality. In the end, if they do not like a product, they will ultimately find a better product somewhere else.

# How do I approach designing software?

The way I approach designing software is to incorporate an SDLC methodology such as agile methodology and begin working through each phase of the SDLC. It is important to first gather requirements, which include user requirements. Then design can begin followed by development, testing, and deployment. Testing should be incorporated as soon as possible with a mindset that the program or system being developed does not work and that there is something wrong with it. This will help to identify problems sooner and reduce the likelihood of failures occurring in a live environment. Users and stakeholders should be kept in mind throughout this process. Without clients and users, there would be no need for the system or software to be developed. We must create reliable products that function as needed.
